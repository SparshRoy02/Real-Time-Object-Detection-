# Real-Time-Object-Detection-
This project demonstrates real-time object detection with YOLO for image and video datasets. 

FEATURES:

* Run detection on image and video file.

* Draw bounding boxes + labels + confidence on frames.

* Option to save output video or snapshots.
  
* Uses state-of-the-art object detection models (YOLO-based).
  


PREREQUISITES:

* Python 3.8 or higher
   
* Google Colab

* pip

* Image datasets, real time images and video file
  

TECH STACK:

* Programming Language: Python

* Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

* Model: YOLOv8 (ultralitics)

RESULTS:

* Achieved high accuracy on test images (e.g., dogs, cats, everyday objects).

* Successfully detected multiple objects per frame (boats, people, fruits, etc.).

* Performance validated on both images and video streams.


LIMITATIONS:

* Small object detection in cluttered backgrounds can be challenging.

* Performance may drop under heavy occlusion or poor lighting.

* Requires GPU resources for training and fast inference.

* Real-time performance on mobile/embedded devices is still limited.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

* Optimize for edge devices (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi).

* Improve small-object detection with advanced augmentation.

* Extend system to instance segmentation and tracking.

* Deploy as a web app or cloud service.
